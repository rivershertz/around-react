# [Around The U.S. - React](https://rivershertz.github.io/around-react/)
### Front-end development - React

#### Description
This project is duplicate of "web_project_4" I crerated, only this time - in React.
##### Phase 1
At this stage not every functionallity is working yet, but here is the list of some that do work by now -
* Fetching user data and cards data from the server
* Opening and closing modals
* Opening and closing the inlarged images by clicking on the cards in the feed

In this phase Ive experienced the process of translating code structure from one technology to another, utilizing my knoledge and understanding of code to create a similar outcome by using a different method.
Lots of joy as usual!

##### Phase 2
Up untill this point all of the functionallity is working! the user can edit his profile and add some places to the cards. Although there is still room for improvement on the UX side...
In this phase I've used context and ref, worked with some more Api requests.
This time around went much more fluently!
Lots of joy coding as usual!

##### Technologies
* React
